# Avalanche Integration Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your actual values
# DO NOT commit .env to version control - it contains sensitive information

# Avalanche Wallet Configuration
# Your private key for the wallet that will make predictions
# Generate this from your wallet (MetaMask, etc.) - must start with 0x
AVALANCHE_PRIVATE_KEY=0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef

# Your wallet address (public address corresponding to the private key above)
# This should start with 0x
WALLET_ADDRESS=0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890

# MusicPredictionOracle Contract Address
# Set this after deploying the contract to Avalanche
# Leave empty until you deploy the contract
PREDICTION_ORACLE_ADDRESS=

# Optional: RPC URL override (uses default Avalanche RPC if not set)
# AVALANCHE_RPC_URL=https://api.avax-test.network/ext/bc/C/rpc

# Optional: Network selection (fuji for testnet, mainnet for mainnet)
# AVALANCHE_NETWORK=fuji

# Security Notes:
# 1. Never commit your actual .env file to version control
# 2. Keep your private key secure and never share it
# 3. Use a dedicated wallet for testing, not your main wallet
# 4. For production, consider using hardware wallets or key management services
# 5. The private key gives full access to your wallet - treat it like a password

# Getting Started:
# 1. Copy this file to .env: cp .env.example .env
# 2. Replace the example values with your actual wallet information
# 3. Deploy the MusicPredictionOracle contract using deploy_contract.py
# 4. Set PREDICTION_ORACLE_ADDRESS to your deployed contract address
# 5. Test the integration with python avalanche_song_predictor.py

# Funding Your Wallet:
# For Fuji testnet: Get free AVAX from https://faucet.avax.network/
# For mainnet: You'll need to purchase AVAX and transfer to your wallet

# Recommended Wallet Setup for Testing:
# 1. Create a new wallet specifically for this project
# 2. Add Avalanche Fuji testnet to your wallet:
#    - Network Name: Avalanche Fuji Testnet
#    - RPC URL: https://api.avax-test.network/ext/bc/C/rpc
#    - Chain ID: 43113
#    - Currency Symbol: AVAX
#    - Block Explorer: https://testnet.snowtrace.io
# 3. Get testnet AVAX from the faucet
# 4. Use this wallet's private key and address in your .env file
